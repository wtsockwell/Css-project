Gathered for a quest for the duke who is rebuking agaisnt his king who has chosen bad counsil. Birth the Marblin's quest for a "soup bowl"

fought off a group of bandits protecting a caravan. The glorius Dagger ricoche and the first of many Lance throws. 

First village with a traveling merchant where Chris (B.) shot an arrow through his caravan and lost 65 gold, and Ian groped the merchant and gave him a hardon. He will never deal to Chris.

Headed to the bandit's camp as per orders, climbing trees, naked woman illusion, and talking badgers. All of the bandits know of the heroes because of a bad attack roll, and they are now converging on them.

Killed all of the bandits and proceeded to loot the camp. Gold was had by all and I earned a Jewel encrusted Rapier with a pearl, ruby and Saphire. Marblin earned a 2 handed great sword, plans to sell. Tristan has op spiders and Chris gets a Panther.

Bandit leader comes back to life before we enter into a cave, we promptly kill him really, really fast. We entered the cave and took out a group of four skeletons and open a door into a large branching hall. 

Everyone is starting to get tired of Marblin's shit. Murderous intentions are on the rise.
